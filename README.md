# Python Weather App
*Very basic Python weather app built using OpenWeatherMap API, and tkinter.*

**What I enjoyed while building this app:** I wanted to be sure that I'm keeping up with my Python while I've spent so much time on the front-end focus of my bootcamp. I don't want to forget what I learned! It was really nice to come back to Python and learn about how to call APIs in Python programs. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Finding documentation to help me build this...it's been a little while since I've built programs rather than just static websites, so I had to look up a lot how-tos for a lot of this. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** API functionality!
